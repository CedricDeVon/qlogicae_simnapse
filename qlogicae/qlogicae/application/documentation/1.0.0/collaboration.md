<h2>Questions and Answers (QnA)</h2>

<p>The following is a list of notable questions and their respective answers regarding this project:</p>

<h3>1. For such a simple set of requirements, why implement it as a desktop application?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            A console application should be sufficient enough to allow users to as least input learning parameters, teach the model, and display evaluation-related information on the console. However, this application is designed to be used by common, interested people.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development team kept in mind the context that most people are not proficient with the console, thus we came to the desktop conclusion.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Why only Windows?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Having said that, it would make sense to have a working application version for the most popular operating systems. While the development team can implement it to be so, we only possess a Windows operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would be wise that we should only release applications that can run on platforms we can reliably use, test, and possess.
        </p>

</ul>
